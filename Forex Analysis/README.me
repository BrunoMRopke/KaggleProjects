#Objective:

    This project aimed to apply various machine learning (ML) models to specific pairs in the forex market, focusing on the USDJPY pair and its indirect counterparts such as EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCHF, USDCNH, AUDUSD, and USDCAD. The goal was to explore the efficacy of ML models in predicting forex market trends.

#Data and Features: 
    The primary dataset included the USDJPY pair and its related forex pairs. Additional features like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and daily returns (target variable) were integrated to enrich the analysis.

#Methodology:
   The project involved comprehensive data preparation and treatment using popular data science libraries. A suite of ML models was employed, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression (SVR), K Neighbors Regressor, and MLPRegressor. Additionally, MinMax Scaler was utilized for data normalization, and GridSearch was implemented to optimize hyperparameters across models.

#Results:
    The application of ML models yielded varying results in different configurations. The evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and cross-validation revealed discrepancies, likely due to the data's strong temporal relationship. The varying performance highlighted the challenges in predicting forex market trends using standard ML approaches.

#Future Implications and Adaptations:
    The findings suggest potential in applying and appropriately adjusting these models, considering temporal conditions linked to the target variable. This analysis sets the stage for further experimentation with neural networks and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, which are more adept at handling temporal data. This direction could lead to more robust and accurate forex market predictions.
