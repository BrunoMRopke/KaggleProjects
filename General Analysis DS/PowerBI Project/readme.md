### Introduction
Welcome to my Power BI project, part of my professional portfolio, designed to demonstrate advanced data analysis and visualization skills within a real-world business scenario. This project highlights the strategic use of inventory data to drive decision-making processes, optimized resource allocation, and improved operational efficiencies.

#### Project Structure

### Data Sources: 
Our project also utilizes cloud storage platforms like OneDrive for Business and Google Drive, where collaborative and up-to-date documents such as reports, spreadsheets, and presentations are stored.
### Transformations and Modeling: 
This project necessitated a thorough remodeling of the original files to facilitate a comprehensive analysis. The data transformation process involved a Python script for preliminary modifications, complemented by Azure Services for automation. Detailed Azure implementation steps are beyond this project's scope.

Further data enhancements were executed in Power BI using DAX for advanced analytics, including custom formulas and added columns. This dual approach ensured efficient data preparation and dynamic modeling, setting the foundation for insightful analysis with a blend of Python's data manipulation capabilities and Power BI's analytical power.
### Visualizations: 
The visualizations in this project are designed to provide a comprehensive overview of storage, segmented by material type. They were developed to assist stakeholders in optimizing both internal and external product reallocation processes. Through tailored graphical representations, these visualizations aim to facilitate informed decision-making by highlighting key storage trends and identifying opportunities for efficiency improvements in product handling.   
### Dashboards and Reports: 
The outcomes of this project are encapsulated in dashboards and reports that illustrate storage levels across various units and highlight the predominant quantities of each material type. These insights are pivotal for users, indicating the imperative to reallocate resources and redistribute products on 'Lower Shelves' to enhance efficiency in replenishment during production processes. By visualizing these metrics, the dashboards and reports serve as essential tools for streamlining inventory management and optimizing operational workflows.
