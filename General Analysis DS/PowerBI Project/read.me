#This project is a comprehensive showcase designed for my portfolio, aiming to demonstrate my capabilities in handling real-world data to derive key insights for inventory management decisions across and within business units. The datasets and solution presented stem from an actual business environment, though modifications have been made to both structure and content to ensure the company's confidentiality.

####Project Objective

#The primary goal of this project is to highlight crucial indicators that facilitate decision-making processes related to inventory movements. By leveraging these insights, businesses can optimize their operations, ensuring efficient resource allocation and enhancing overall performance.

####Data and Solution Confidentiality

#To maintain the privacy of the involved enterprise, original files have been carefully altered. It is crucial to note that these alterations do not detract from the solution's validity or its applicability to similar scenarios in other organizations. The original datasets were extracted directly from a controlled environment in OneDrive for Business, with access to the reports restricted to a select list of users to ensure data security and integrity.

####Access Control

#Access to the project's reports and data is meticulously governed through the creation of a restricted user list. This approach ensures that sensitive information remains secure and is only accessible to authorized personnel, reflecting best practices in data management and security.
