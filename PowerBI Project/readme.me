Introduction
This project serves as a practical simulation of data analysis expectations and outcomes within a professional environment, grounded in personal study and experience in the field of data analysis. The dataset analyzed, which is 67MB in size and sourced from the Kaggle platform, was chosen to deepen understanding of the Power BI platform's capabilities. All analyses conducted as part of this project were purely for educational purposes, aiming to replicate the kind of insights and challenges one might encounter in a real-world data analysis scenario.

Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Sourcing the Data
Objective: Obtain the dataset from Kaggle.

Action: Navigate to the Kaggle website, search for the specific dataset (67MB in size), and download it to your local machine.

Step 2: Storing the Data in Google Colab
Objective: Simulate an environment that mimics querying from the original database to minimize future performance issues for users.
Action: Upload the downloaded dataset to Google Colab. This step simulates storing the file in an environment that's closer to a database, reducing the load on Power BI during data retrieval and analysis, thus mimicking a more efficient data querying process typical in professional settings.

Step 3: Preparing the Data and Creating Dimension Tables with Python and SQL
Objective: Ensure the dataset is ready for analysis and alleviate resources when executing queries in the tool.
Action: Within Google Colab, utilize Python and SQL commands to perform initial formatting of the dataset and generate dimension tables. This process involves:
Analyzing the dataset to identify potential dimension tables.
Using Python for data manipulation tasks, such as filtering, cleaning, and structuring data.
Employing SQL queries to further refine and create dimension tables, which will be used in Power BI for more efficient querying.
The alternation between Python and SQL commands serves not only to optimize the data for analysis but also as an educational exercise to understand different approaches to data manipulation and preparation.

Step 4: Loading the Data into Power BI Using QuickQuery and Direct Import
Objective: Import the dataset and dimension tables into Power BI for analysis.
Action:
For the sales environment reports, to maintain efficient updates, select the QuickQuery mode when importing the main dataset. This method ensures timely updates by fetching data as needed, reducing the load and maintaining performance.
Import the other dimensional tables directly into Power BI. This allows for a comprehensive data model that supports in-depth analysis while ensuring that the most critical dataset for operational reporting remains efficiently updatable.

Step 5: Applying Queries for Data Preparation and Cleaning
Objective: Optimize and clean the data for analysis.
Action: After loading the data into Power BI, apply Power Query Editor to perform data preparation and cleaning tasks. This includes:
Removing unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.
Handling missing values either by removing rows, replacing with suitable values, or imputing based on data patterns.
Transforming data types for accurate analysis (e.g., converting string dates to datetime format).
Creating calculated columns if necessary to enhance the data model for more in-depth analysis.
These steps are crucial for ensuring the data is in the best possible shape for creating meaningful visualizations and extracting reliable insights.

Step 6: Creating Visualizations and Developing the Relational Model
Objective: Develop visual representations of your data and construct a relational model to uncover insights.
Action:
Developing the Relational Model: Before diving into visualization, focus on defining the relational entities among the tables. This involves establishing clear relationships between your main dataset and the dimension tables, including the ones created in previous steps. Utilize Power BI's data modeling tools to accurately represent these relationships, ensuring a robust foundation for analysis.

Creating a Date Reference Table: Recognizing the importance of date-based analysis in this project, create a dedicated Date table. This table is generated based on the historical date range present within the dataset and is designed to support future calculations, such as time-based trends and comparative analysis over different periods. The Date table becomes a central piece in the relational model, linking to other tables where date fields are relevant.

Visualization: With the relational model set, including the Date table, proceed to utilize Power BI’s visualization tools. Create charts, graphs, and maps that highlight the data’s patterns, trends, and anomalies. The established relational model allows for dynamic and complex analyses, facilitated by the comprehensive Date table. Experiment with different visualization types to best convey the story behind the data, taking advantage of the relational model to explore various angles and depths of analysis.
